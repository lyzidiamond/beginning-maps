Let's Make A Map!
==============

This is an exercise geared towards the younger generation (written for a Girl Scouts troop of nine-year-olds) about making maps using [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com). The slide deck is made using [big](http://github.com/tmcw/big).

## What's in here?

### The slide deck (on the slides page) includes:

- What is a web map?
- What might you include on a web map?
- What should you **not** include on your map?
- A step-by-step tutorial on using Mapbox's [browser editing interface](http://mapbox.com).

### The about page includes:

- A page for parents/teachers on how to use the resources contained and their role in making it successful
- A list of things to do after giving this presentation to continue teaching about maps and geography + more information on some of the topics.
- Some photos of cats.

## Can I change things?

Yes please. Fork, make changes, make pull requests. I want to build a tool that's useful for kids of all ages and gets them excited about maps.

### Some other things that I'd like to do if I ever have free time again:

- Make an adult version of this to teach geospatial concepts in a way that is slightly more verbose while also including the exercise in making a map using Mapbox.
- Make an "OSM Editing for Kids" exercise.
- More cat photos.
